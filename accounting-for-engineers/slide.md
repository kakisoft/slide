In others books, they divide by accounting title  

But, he use more easier way.  
So, I will tell you that method.

## before that ...

debit means **"ME"**  

credit means **"YOU"**  

<br>

It is most import point.

## basic idea of accounting

There is many accounting title   
for example ...  

 * Checking accounts
 * Finished goods
 * Accounts payable
 * Capital stock

but...  

---

You only focus on **"You got money"** or **"You lost money"** regaredless of accounting title  

---

If you got money, you input amount of money in debit.  

If you lost money, you input amount of money in credit.
