cf. escape room is called "リアル脱出ゲーム" in Japan.<br>
It's really exciting entertainment.  <br>
You use deductive skill and inspiration and team work, then solve challenging puzzles.</small>

---

First, I am going to talk a little more about my background.

---

I'm a software engineer. Especially, I created many logistic systems.

---

I have experiences in launching and stabilization of warehouse management systems.

So, I'm a software engineer and also a logistics specialist.

---

This presentation is based on my expertise in logistics.

---

First of all, this presentation doesn't explain all logistics field.  

It's case by case.

---

To start with, I will explain 6 main categories	in logistics.

---

### 6 main categories in logistics.
<br>

 * Transport and delivery
 * Storage
 * Packaging
 * Cargo handling
 * Distribution processing
 * Data processing

---

This presentation explains two out of all categories.

### 6 main categories in logistics.
<br>

 * Transport and delivery
 * <span class="right-blue">Storage</span>
 * Packaging
 * Cargo handling
 * Distribution processing
 * <span class="right-blue">Data processing</span>

---

I will talk about warehouse management system.

---

Warehouse management system has these functions.

as follows:

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * Arrival
 * Shipment
 * Stock taking
 * Data exchange
 * Requirement and payment

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * <span class="right-blue">Arrival</span>
 * Shipment
 * Stock taking
 * Data exchange
 * Requirement and payment

---

### Arrival
<br>

Arrival is the process of putting goods from a supplier into a warehouse.

---

It doesn't become so complex in many cases.  

And, you almost don't have to change and add functions  

---

You can assign junior and middle level engineers to  the tasks.  

<br>

<big>**resources required : intermediate**</big>

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * Arrival
 * <span class="right-blue">Shipment</span>
 * Stock taking
 * Data exchange
 * Requirement and payment

---

### Shipment
<br>

Shipment is the process of bring out some items from warehouses to customers.

---

It tends to be complex.

And, sometimes we have to adjust the system because of the clients' circumstances.

---

Even if you launch the system, it is common you have to modify the system's' function.

You should assign the ace to this function.

<br>

<big>**resources required : high**</big>

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * Arrival
 * Shipment
 * <span class="right-blue">Stock taking</span>
 * Data exchange
 * Requirement and payment

---

### Stock taking

Stock taking is the process of chekiang number of items in warehouses.

---

You can manage the work at the warehouse even if you don't spend time to create the function.

---

Normally, You use handy terminal when you do Stock taking.

But, there are cases when it is not realistic to read barcode of each item in a warehouse.

---

In that case, you check the inventory by looking while look some statement.

---

In many cases, you can finish only office work.

<br>

<big>**resources required : low**</big>

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * Arrival
 * Shipment
 * Stock taking
 * <span class="right-blue">Data exchange</span>
 * Requirement and payment

---

### Data exchange

Data exchange is the process which exchanges electronic data with other companies.

For example ASN data, shipping instruction data, and stock taking data.

---

The most important points in this process are <big>**negotiation skill**</big> and <big>**political skill**</big>.

---

If you accept clients' offer without question, your company's work will drastically increase.

If you want to avoid these outcome, project manager is required to have negotiation skill.

---

When you create this function, Accuracy is more important than development speed.

A careful engineer who has few bugs is more suitable for this process than a careless engineer who can make it quickly.

<br>

<big>**resources required : intermediate to high**</big>

---

### Warehouse management system functions

 * Arrival
 * Shipment
 * Stock taking
 * Data exchange
 * <span class="right-blue">Requirement and payment</span>

---

If you can't simplify it, you shouldn't add this function.

---

In some cases, you are required to have knowledge of accounting, and swayed by strange local rules.

---

If this rule is too complex, you feel you are creating account system, rather than logistic system.

---

In addition, Some customer have own calculation rules.
And, sometimes they change the rules.

---

It is hard to catch up with the rules.

Some cases, you have to change the calculation logic drastically.

---

In some cases,   

"complex calculation method with more office work which may be cheap depending on patten"

is prefered to  

"simple and relatively expensive calculation method with less office work"  

---

In this case, you should lead the customers to calculate on their own.

But, It often doesn't work well according to your ideal.

---

As discussed, for some cases you shouldn't use only techlogy when you solove the customers problem.

---

lastly, I want to speak about when you launch WMS system.

---

There are many varieties of sites in logistic industory.

---

If you have own systems, it is not suitable in warehouses in some cases.

---

If you encounter such sutiation, you will choose one of these options.

---

### System introduction pattern
<br>

 * case 1 : Change the systems to suit the work style.

 * case 2 : Change work style to suit the systems.

---

### System introduction pattern
<br>

 * <span class="right-blue">case 1 : Change the systems to suit the work style.</span>

 * case 2 : Change work style to suit the systems.

---

It is easier than another case.  

Many customers request this style.

---

But, if you accept the request, the system will have the specific function for indivisual customer.  

As a result, the system will be complex.

---

### System introduction pattern
<br>

 * case 1 : Change the systems to suit the work style.

 * <span class="right-blue">case 2 : Change work style to suit the systems.</span>

---

Many customers are not willing to accept your suggestion.  

You can spend long time to persuade them.

---

And also, if your company don't have political power, you often can't do this method.

But, if you want to get a big success in business, you should do this method.

But, if you choose this way, you have to work hard.

---

There is no wrong answer.

CEO or manager have to decide which way to go, on their judgement.

---

There are many varieties of methods depending on logistic site.  
Situations change day by day.

---

It is important to suggest what you can do with limited resources.

---

But, many logistic sites are working on old systems and mechanism.

---

The idea that innovative technologies change the world is important.

---

It is important to fucus on current chaotic environment and the workers who are busy with their daily task, and to explore more efficient method.
